My experience on attending an AI Meetup :
	I had a chance to go to a couple of AI meetups. But i will be summarizing my experience one of my AI MEETUP.
	Topics Covered: Automatic speech translation from Hindi to Kannada by using OpenCV and Convolution Neural Networks.
	The meetup covered more technical aspects of opencv and CNN's. The presentor explained us the techinques used in opencv for obtaining the data from scanned images. 
	He was using some techinques to split the rows and columns in the image to get the individual words. Post obtaining the individual words he created the input_vector
	and the output_vector. 
	Post obtaining the vector he used CNN to create a prediction model with accepts a word in Kannada and predicts its equivalent word in Hindi.
	
	This was the content for the first half of AI meetup . The second half covered basic of Recurrent Neural Networks and discussed on ResNet Research Paper(especially
	the concepts of upsampling and downasampling images).
